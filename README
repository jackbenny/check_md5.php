check_md5.php

A Nagios plugin written in PHP to check the MD5 sum of a single file. 
In case the files MD5 change the plugin issues a critical state. This behavior 
can be changed by using a --warning argument, so that only a warning state is 
issued. 
This is a re-write of my previous check_md5 that was written in Bash. The Bash
version is more tested and should work better. I wrote this this version mainly
as a way to practice some PHP.

NOTE: For this script to work you need PEAR Console_GetoptPlus (or
Console_Getopt). 
See http://pear.php.net/package/Console_GetoptPlus for more information on how
to install Console_GetoptPlus.
